Description: Multi-block data analysis concerns the analysis of several
    sets of variables (blocks) observed on the same group of individuals.
    The main aims of the RGCCA package are: to study the relationships
    between blocks and to identify subsets of variables of each block
    which are active in their relationships with the other blocks. This
    package allows to (i) run R/SGCCA and related methods (\link{rgcca}),
    (ii) help the user to find out the optimal parameters for R/SGCCA such
    as regularization parameters (tau or sparsity)
    (\link{rgcca_permutation}, \link{rgcca_cv}), (iii) evaluate the
    stability of the RGCCA results and their significance
    (\link{rgcca_bootstrap} and \link{rgcca_stability}), (iv) build predictive
    models from the R/SGCCA (\link{rgcca_predict}), (v) Generic print()
    and plot() functions apply to all these functionalities.
