Description: Multi-block data analysis concerns the analysis of several sets of variables (blocks) observed on the same group of individuals. The main aims of the RGCCA package are: to study the relationships between blocks and to identify subsets of variables of each block which are active in their relationships with the other blocks. This package allows to (i) run R/SGCCA (\link{rgcca}), (ii) help the user to find out the optimal parameters for R/SGCCA such as sparsity or number of components(\link{rgcca_permutation}), (iii) evaluate the stability of the RGCCA results and their significance (\link{bootstrap}) Print and plots of all these functionalities are available.
